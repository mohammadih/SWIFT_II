# Figures Documentation

This directory contains visualization outputs from the SWIFT II DRL-assisted spectrum selection simulations.

## Generated Figures

### Training and Learning Curves

- **`DDQN Loss Convergence.png`**: Shows the convergence of the Q-network loss function over training iterations, demonstrating learning stability.

- **`Exploration Rate Decay.png`**: Displays the ε-greedy exploration rate decay over time, showing the transition from exploration to exploitation.

- **`Channel Selection Frequency.png`**: Histogram showing the frequency of selection for each channel, indicating learned channel preferences.

### Channel Modeling

- **`HFS_Channel_2D.png`**: 2D visualization of the Highly Frequency Selective (HFS) channel response.

- **`HFS_Channel_3D.png`**: 3D visualization of the HFS channel response showing frequency-time variations.

### Signal Processing

- **`Pssive Signal_Spectrum.png`**: Power spectral density of the passive sensor signal.

- **`Received Signal Spectrum.png`**: Power spectral density of the total received signal (active + passive).

- **`Selected_Spectrum.png`**: Spectrum after DRL agent selection, showing interference mitigation.

### System Architecture

- **`Overal Concept.png`**: High-level system architecture diagram showing the interaction between 5G transceiver, passive sensor, and DRL agent.

- **`SIC-system_model_architecture.png`**: Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) system model architecture.

## Usage

These figures are generated automatically during:
- **Python DRL Training** (`DDQN.py`): Generates loss, reward, exploration, and channel selection plots
- **MATLAB Channel Simulation** (`my_NRChannel_modified.m`): Generates channel response heatmaps
- **MATLAB Signal Processing** (`ActivePassiveAI_Sensing.m`): Generates PSD and spectrogram plots

## Figure Generation

### From Python (`DDQN.py`)

The script generates three figures:
1. Accumulated reward and loss convergence (subplot)
2. Exploration rate decay curve
3. Channel selection frequency histogram

### From MATLAB

- Channel response heatmaps are generated by `my_NRChannel_modified.m` when `OFDM_Response=true`
- PSD plots are generated by `my_pspectrum.m` and `ActivePassiveAI_Sensing.m`

## Notes

- All figures are saved in PNG format for compatibility
- Figure resolution and styling can be adjusted in the respective code files
- Some figures may require specific MATLAB toolboxes (e.g., Signal Processing Toolbox for `pspectrum`)
